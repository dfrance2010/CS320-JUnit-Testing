How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Ensuring that code, program, or software are functional and secure involves both static and dynamic testing. This means identifying requirements, writing tests to ensure those requirements are met, and analyzing code for any security weaknesses.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I try to make sure requirements are clear before I start to work on a program. If they are not, this should be addressed with stakeholders up front, so no unnecessary work is done. On top of that, there might be some needs that the user doesn't know about, such as input validation or parameterization, that should be done as a matter of technically sound and secure programming.

How do I approach designing software?

First, I identify what the software is meant to do, including any specific requirements. Then I map out what I think is the best solution. After analyzing the rough draft I'll start programming. At the same time, I'll think about what tests need to be run to ensure I've met the user's need.
